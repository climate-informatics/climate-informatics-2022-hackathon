## Drought prediction challenge

Drought can lead to substantial environmental, societal, and economic impacts and can become more severe 
and prolonged regionally in a changing climate. Being able to accurately predict such events helps to 
mitigate and prepare. This yearâ€™s Climate Informatics Hackathon aims to forecast droughts in South Sudan
and Ethiopia. Using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as a target measure, the challenge is to 
leverage the spatio-temporal modeling power of machine learning to anticipate those dangerous hazards far
in advance to support mitigation efforts.

## Access to JupyterHub environment

Registered conference attendees who attend hackathon can access the JupyterHub environment built on Amazon
Web Services via attendees' GitHub ID.

Access JupyterHub [here](https://oasis.ncics.org).

To access GPU resources for model development, start a **g4dn.xlarge** server when starting up.

## Data

The hackathon uses data from Community Earth System Model (CESM) for the model training and development.

> The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM LENS) 
> dataset includes a 40-member ensemble of climate simulations for the period 1920-2100. All model runs were 
> subject to the same radiative forcing scenario: historical up to 2005, and RCP8.5 thereafter. 
> (RCP8.5 - Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 - refers to the worst-case scenario considered in the 
> Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC). Each of the 40 runs begins
>  from a slightly different initial atmospheric state (created by randomly perturbing temperatures at the 
>  level of round-off error). The data comprise both surface (2D) and volumetric (3D) variables in the atmosphere,
>   ocean, land, and ice domains.
>   
> The total LENS data volume is ~500 TB, and is traditionally accessible through the NCAR Climate Data Gateway (CDG)
>  for download or via web services. A subset (currently ~70 TB compressed) including the most useful variables is 
>  now freely available on AWS S3 thanks to the AWS Public Dataset Program.
